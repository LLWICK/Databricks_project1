# Databricks Data Engineering Project (Medallion Architecture)

This project is a hands-on data engineering implementation using Databricks to understand how modern data pipelines are built using the Lakehouse and Medallion Architecture concepts.

The project was developed by following a Databricks data engineering tutorial and adapted with my own experimentation to explore Spark-based data processing, transformations, and analytics.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

Learn Databricks fundamentals

Build an end-to-end data pipeline

Apply Bronze → Silver → Gold (Medallion Architecture)

Prepare clean and structured data for analytics and dashboards

The project uses Databricks notebooks with PySpark to ingest, transform, and organize data efficiently.

🏗️ Architecture Used

Medallion Architecture

Bronze Layer – Raw data ingestion

Silver Layer – Cleaned and transformed data

Gold Layer – Aggregated, analytics-ready data

This layered approach improves:

Data quality

Scalability

Maintainability of pipelines


🔧 Technologies & Tools

Databricks (Community / Free Edition)

Apache Spark (PySpark)

Python

Lakehouse Architecture

Databricks Notebooks

🚀 Key Learnings

Working with Databricks notebooks and Spark clusters

Designing scalable ETL pipelines

Applying medallion architecture in real projects

Transforming raw data into analytics-ready datasets

Understanding how data engineering workflows support BI and ML use cases


📈 Future Improvements

Add data validation and quality checks

Automate pipelines using Databricks Jobs

Integrate Delta Lake optimizations

Extend dashboards with more insights
